In this program we are creating a pyramid.
And let’s allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

Here’s how the program will work if the user inputs 8 when prompted:

              #
             ##
            ###
           ####
          #####
         ######
        #######
       ########

Here’s how the program will work if the user inputs 2 when prompted:

        #
       ##

And here’s how the program will work if the user inputs 1 when prompted:

       #

Kindly note that if the user enter a negative number, the program should continuously asking for a positive integer.
